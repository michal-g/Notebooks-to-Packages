## Converting a Jupyter notebook into a script ##

![](../resources/x-files-analysis.jpeg)

We've decided that our UFO sightings experiment has enough merit to warrant deeper analysis. This means that it's time
to consider the tools available in Python to make expanding our analysis code easier, starting with command-line
scripts.

The scripts included in this chapter should be run from within an activated `notebooks-packages` conda environment; see
documentation within each script and the README for this repository for further details.


### A) Converting a notebook into a script ###


### B) Using argparse to parametrize our script ###


### C) Using functions to modularize our script ###
