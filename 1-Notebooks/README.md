## Analyzing a public dataset using a Jupyter notebook ##

![](../resources/mulder-scully.jpeg)

We found a [website](https://nuforc.org/databank/) listing reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)
and we would like to create a machine learning algorithm that can predict the number of sightings in a given time
period.

To begin, this analysis will be done in a Jupyter notebook to make exploratory analyses easier. What about notebooks
makes exploration so convenient?
