## Analyzing a public dataset using a Jupyter notebook ##

![](../resources/mulder-scully.jpeg)


We found a [website](https://nuforc.org/databank/) listing reported sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)
and created a notebook implementing a machine learning algorithm that predicts numbers of sightings in a set of years.
In this chapter we will examine why notebooks are useful tools for researchers and data scientists, and consider when
and why they become limiting as an analysis pipeline grows in scope.

If you have a Google account, use the above link to run the UFO sightings notebook in Colab; otherwise, either download
the notebook and run it with the version of Jupyter installed as part of this repository's `notebooks-packages` conda
environment or use Princeton's
[compute services](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/jupyter) to run the notebook remotely.


### Notebooks: the good side ###


### When to consider using scripts? ###
